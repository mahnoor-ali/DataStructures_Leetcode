Here are a few things to look for when trying to identify whether a problem in competitive programming is related to trees or graphs:

---- Trees ---
If the problem mentions a hierarchical structure, like a family tree or a file system.
If the problem involves traversing a set of nodes in a specific order, like inorder or preorder.
If the problem mentions a root node or parent-child relationships.


--- Graphs ---
If the problem mentions a set of nodes and edges connecting them.
If the problem involves finding the shortest path between two nodes.
If the problem involves finding connected components or detecting cycles.
If the problem mention about finding spanning tree.
