SELECT score,
dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS 'rank'
FROM scores
ORDER BY score DESC


-- Explanation:
The dense_rank() function is then used to calculate the rank of each record, based on the score. 
    The dense_rank() function assigns the same rank to records with the same score and assigns the next rank to the next unique score.
   The OVER clause specifies the ordering of the scores by the score in descending order (ORDER BY score DESC).
